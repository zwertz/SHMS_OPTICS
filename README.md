The development goal for this code is to generate the optics matrix elements for high momentum settings in the SHMS for the LAD Experiment.

Initially, this repository contained the most recent version of the SHMS Optics code from the cafe experiment in Hall C, and is from the repository: [cafe_optics](https://github.com/hszumila/cafe_optics). The purpose of the code is to generate the optics matrix elements for high momentum settings in the SHMS. 

Original versions of the code were written by Mark Jones and Holly Szumila-Vance at Jefferson Lab. Presumably the orignal verions of this code were based on the repositories: [cafe_optics](https://github.com/hszumila/cafe_optics) and [HMS_OPTICS_HIGH_MOM](https://github.com/hszumila/HMS_OPTICS_HIGH_MOM).
